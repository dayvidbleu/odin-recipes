        <h2>Afang soup:a nutricious and delicious Nigerian delicacy</h2>
        <p>Afang soup is a delicacy nigeria native to the efik and ibibio people of southern 
            nigeria althoug it is enjoyed by all that has had a taste of it.</p>
            <p>Afang Soup is soup rich in meats and vegetables and palm oil. 
If you are averse to palm oil then this soup may not be for you. 
Some people actually make this oil free but Noooo I can't make this soup oil free lol.
 The oil is the real deal in this recipe. I am sure the originators of this dish will
agree with me ?. Oil compliments most vegetable soups like Afang and Edikang ikong.
 Having tasted Afang with oil. 
I doubt you can convince me to ditch the oil in this recipe.
